# John Whiles - CV
## Profile
A full stack developer with an interest in functional programming and types.

I care about improving diversity and accessibility in tech and I value simplicity in
design. 


## Tech Experience

### Full Stack Engineer - Habito
__July 2018 - Present__
    At Habito I have worked on various user focused projects, ranging from a
  redesigned homepage, to a re-implementation of the dynamic fact find which is the core of
  Habito's user journey. One of my main focuses has been to improve
  the accessibility of the projects I work on, by focusing on users' needs as well as on 
  more technical matters.
    At Habito we use PureScript and Haskell for all development work. These
  languages have taught me a lot about functional programming. I am comfortable with the
  core features of both languages, and have a growing familiarity with the ecosystems 
  of libraries and language extensions which surround them.
  
  
### Full Stack Engineer - The Trainline
__January 2018 - July 2018__

  At the Trainline I worked on customer facing services which needed to be reliable and 
scalable. A lot of my work was focused on optimisation - and I learnt
that building services that respond quickly to users is one of the best ways
to drive conversion.
  The major project I worked on was re-platforming one of the Trainline's most 
heavily trafficked web services from .NET to Node.js whilst improving it's feature-set
and performance. 

### JavaScript Engineer - Just Giving
__March 2017 - January 2018__

  At Just Giving I created great user experiences for charities and their supporters 
using the best of the modern JavaScript ecosystem. As part of a cross functional team I
worked closely with C# developers and web designers to ensuring end-user satisfaction.
  I was heavily involved in maintaining a library of reusable code which includes 
user interface components, a comprehensive style guide, and server side utilities.
  I introduced TypeScript to my team, which improved the reliability of our products
and showed me the benefits of static tying.

### Developer - Founders and Coders
__October 2016 - February 2017__

During this highly selective, intensive web development bootcamp I learnt the 
fundamentals of working as a software developer by creating a series of projects as part
of agile teams. Working across the stack from front ends to SQL databases I
created  applications ranging from search auto-completes, to minimal viable 
products for charity partners.
