# John Whiles - CV
## Profile
A full stack web developer based in London. I love learning and building a deep understanding of the technologies I use. Examples of my work across the tech stack can be found on [my Github page](https://github.com/jwhiles).

I am primarily a Javascript developer, but am keen to branch out into other programming languages. I strive to write the purest and most functional code I can - as I believe that it is the best way to make a program testable and reliable.

I am eager to become the best developer I can be. As such I hope to work in an environment which encourages personal development and allows me to work with talented people on great projects.

## Projects
### CV Site
[Github](https://github.com/Jwhiles/cv-site)

A personal website built to present my CV and host a development focused blog. The site is built on Hapi, and uses SASS to ensure consistent styling. The blog utilises a custom CMS built with PostgreSQL. It serves markdown content, and can be easily updated from any web browser through a secure admin route.

### Hapi and Express Boilerplates
[Hapi Github](https://github.com/Jwhiles/hapi-boilerpalte) | [Express Github](https://github.com/Jwhiles/express-boilerplate)

Simple boilerplate servers for two popular Node.js frameworks. These were built to allow myself and others to quickly get more complex servers up and running.

### GitPom
[Web link](https://salty-wave-92062.herokuapp.com/) | [Github](https://github.com/The-Authenticators/gitpom)

A productivity tool built as part of a small team whilst studying at Founders and Coders. The website integrates with OAuth on Github to lets users select a Github issue to work on. When an issue is selected the site will start a [Pomodoro Timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Once the timer has finished, the user is prompted to take a break, and can mark whether the issue has been resolved.

### Autocomplete
[Web link](https://autocomplete-heroku.herokuapp.com/) | [Github](https://github.com/Jwhiles/autocomplete)

A simple text autocomplete, built as part of a small team whilst studying at Founders and Coders. As the user types the app consults a dictionary stored on the server and shows a list of suggested words

## Previous Experience
### Next
*2015*

I worked as a trainee Merchandiser at Next's head office. I was responsible for Next's stock of mirrors - an area with an annual budget of Â£4 million. I worked closely with buyers and designers to deliver a compelling range, in order to make our customers happy.

### Premium Models

After graduating I worked as a fashion model. This broadened my horizons and ruined my chances of ever having my own website be the first Google result for my name.
