# John Whiles - CV
## Profile
A full stack developer based in London. 

I care about improving diversity and accessibility in tech. I value simplicity in
design. And enjoy using functional techniques to write comprehensible and testable
code. 

I am particularly interested in working with more functional, and strongly typed, languages. 


## Tech Experience

### Full Stack Engineer - The Trainline
__January 2018 - Present__

  At the Trainline I work on customer facing services which are reliable and 
scalable. A lot of my work has been focused on optimisation - and I have learnt
that building services that respond quickly to users is one of the best ways
to drive conversion.
  I am currently responsible for replatforming one of the Trainline's most 
heavily trafficked web services from .NET to Node.js whilst ensuring full
feature parity and improved efficiency. 

### JavaScript Engineer - Just Giving
__March 2017 - January 2018__

  At Just Giving I created great user experiences for charities and their supporters 
using the best of the modern JavaScript ecosystem. As part of a cross functional team I
worked closely with C# developers and web designers to ensuring end-user satisfaction.
  I was heavily involved in maintaining a library of reusable code which includes 
user interface components, a comprehensive style guide, and server side utilities.
  I introduced TypeScript to my team, which improved the reliability of our products
and showed me the benefits of static tying.

### Developer - Founders and Coders
__October 2016 - February 2017__

During this highly selective, intensive web development bootcamp I learnt the 
fundamentals of working as a software developer by creating a series of projects as part
of agile teams. Working across the stack from front ends to SQL databases I
created  applications ranging from search auto-completes, to minimal viable 
products for charity partners. 

## Technologies used professionally

__React__,
__Redux__,
__Jest__,
