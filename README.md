# John Whiles - CV
## Profile
A full stack JavaScript developer based in London. 

I care about improving diversity and accessibility in tech. I value simplicity in
design. And enjoy using functional techniques to write comprehensible and testable
code. 

I am particularly interested in working with more functional, and strongly typed, languages. 


## Tech Experience

### Full Stack Engineer - The Trainline
__January 2018 - Present__

  At the Trainline I work on customer facing services which are reliable and 
scalable. A lot of work has been focused on optimisation - I was able to make
significant savings in our API spend by improving how we handle loading 
certain data. 
  I am currently responsible for replatforming the company's biggest web 
traffic driver to Node.JS and React, whilst also working as part of a 
larger SEO focused team to ensure common standards are met in our services.

### JavaScript Engineer - Just Giving
__March 2017 - January 2018__

  Creating great user experiences for charities and their supporters using the
best of the modern JavaScript ecosystem. As part of a cross functional team I
work closely with C# developers and web designers using agile methodologies to 
deliver consistent development whilst ensuring end-user satisfaction.
  I was heavily involved in maintaining a library of reusable code which includes 
user interface components, a comprehensive style guide, and server side utilities.

### Developer - Founders and Coders
__October 2016 - February 2017__

During this highly selective, intensive web development bootcamp I learnt the 
fundamentals of working as a software developer by creating a series of projects as part
of agile teams. Working across the stack from front ends to SQL databases I
created  applications ranging from search auto-completes, to minimal viable 
products for charity partners.
